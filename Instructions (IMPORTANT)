Hello and welcome! 

Please read these instructions on how to start and try any of the projects in here. 

1. Download the .Zip file. 
2. Extract the files. 
3. Enter any game folder -> x64 -> Debug. 
4. Double click the exeecutable file called ProjectName.exe i.e. AxeGame.exe, TripleX.exe etc. 
5. Play! 


Note: Bare in mind that these are not full games but merely projects where I have done something specific to learn and grow as a developer.
